I'm Julianne P. Bullen, a computer engineering student. I'm a kind and approachable person, yet I can be shy around new people. 
I enjoy making people laugh since I think that laughing is the best medicine. I have a wild imagination and enjoy coming up with
 my own ideas because I can convey my ideas more clearly. I enjoy drawing, although my skills are still lacking. I prefer a tidy 
 and ordered workplace since it makes it easier for me to concentrate on my studies or do my schoolwork.

 My guiding concept for living my life is to always be at peace with myself,  cherish the present, connect with my loved ones and 
 close friends, be healthy, partake in activities I find enjoyable, and never stop learning and growing as a person.<br><br>
 I am different from others because I have my own likes and dislikes , I have my own experience  with different people  and I 
 have my own perspective in life . I have my own hummer that people can't understand. I make my own decisions and choices very 
 differently from most others . I can be similar to others in terms of culture and nationality.

 My best performance was in elementary school. In my opinion, My parents know how much I love art and how proud I am that they 
 recognize my talent by giving me the “Best in arts” award. Even though it was only a tiny award , my parents nevertheless expressed 
 their happiness for me. </p>
 <p style ="color: #DBF9DB">
 My life's ambition is to complete college and get a well-paying profession. I want to provide for my family so they won't have any 
 trouble making ends meet. With my closest friends, I wish to travel the world and explore other countries, especially Japan. I want 
 to be a family man with a home of my own. In my bedroom, I want to build up a gaming area and make a career out of it.
